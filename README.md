Requirements achieved:

- Fetch upgrade data from the provided API and at least one upgrade from the API update the cookie count.
- Ensure that functions are used effectively to keep code organised and reusable.
- Implement event listeners to handle user interactions.
- Use local storage to save and restore the cookie count and relevant game information.
- Use setInterval to increment the cookie count and manage the game state each second.
- Managing the game state includes saving progress and updating the DOM.
- Improve UX with animations, sound effects, or other visual effects.
- Added 'start again' button which resets the display and stored data in local storage.

Reflections:

- At the start of the week I felt very apprehensive and not at all confident in my ability to use JavaScript. However, this project has been a great learning experience that has helped me to build my understanding of how JavaScript works, including the use of variables, functions, loops, objects, and APIs.
- In addition to meeting the project requirements, I'm pleased to have created a consistent theme by carefully aligning fonts, imagery, sounds and css styling, which hopefully helps the game feel more cohesive.
- I would have loved to implement a theme that reflects my personal interests, such as a crochet version where clicking a ball of yarn increases the stitch count and upgrades might include ergonomic hooks, better lighting, advanced patterns, or even a yarn factory. However, I decided that my time was better spent focusing on meeting the project requirements. Perhaps this could be a personal project for the future(?)
- I know there were other stretch goals I could have attempted, but I’m also learning the importance of work-life balance. As a perfectionist, I feel it's just as important a skill to practice as coding itself - knowing when to put the tools down and step away. It gives me the chance to enjoy my weekend, recharge properly, and come back fresh and ready for new content on Monday.
- I hadn’t even heard of a clicker game until five days ago, so I’m really pleased that I’ve managed to design and build one myself in such a short time.
